# SprintLang

SprintLang is a lightweight markup language (LML) designed for intuitive project management. This language is currently under development with the goal of creating a human-readable and writable language that effectively captures the complexity of project management while enabling automated processing and interaction by language models like ChatGPT. 

It is a personal project that I'd be happy to share, but it is more of a "what if" project than a useable tool today - and that may be all it ever is.

> **I could truely use your help with the design of SprintLang**.  Feel free to send any suggestions my way.  Even if you're a non-technical person but have a good idea create an issue or feature request anyway!   [Contributing](#contributing)

## Background

The SprintLang project began with the recognition of a need for a more streamlined, accessible way of managing projects. Existing tools can be complex and may not offer the flexibility and transparency that many project managers need. SprintLang aims to fill this gap by offering a flexible, easily readable and writable format that can be processed both by humans and machine learning models.

## Current State

SprintLang is currently in the design stage. The basic syntax for defining project metadata, modules, sprints, and tasks has been outlined. The format allows for tasks to be defined in separate files for modularity and better organization. The language supports structured metadata, explicit relations, and standardized fields, making it suitable for processing by language models.

## To-Do

- complete the lml design
- create a Python library
- create command-line interface (CLI) program that
  - can parse SprintLang files
  - interact with the data,
  - provide summaries, suggestions, and other valuable project management insights (possibly using gpt-4)

## Contributing

I absolutely welcome your contributions! I'm excited to receive feedback on SprintLang's design, hear your feature suggestions, and even receive code for the upcoming Python program. Rest assured, this is a no judgment zone. Critism of the design and code is enouraged, but no critism of the contributors will be allowed!

Feel free to ask any questions or make any suggestions you may have. If you have any fixes or code contributions those are welcome too!  I just want to create something cool and useful. Your input and contributions will be received  with grace and appreciation for your willingness to be a part of this project.
