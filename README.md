# SprintLang

SprintLang is a lightweight markup language (LML) designed for intuitive project management. This language is currently under development with the goal of creating a human-readable and writable language that effectively captures the complexity of project management while enabling automated processing and interaction by language models like ChatGPT. 

It is a personal project that I'd be happy to share, but it is more of a "what if" project than a useable tool today - and that may be all it ever is.

## Background

The SprintLang project began with the recognition of a need for a more streamlined, accessible way of managing projects. Existing tools can be complex and may not offer the flexibility and transparency that many project managers need. SprintLang aims to fill this gap by offering a flexible, easily readable and writable format that can be processed both by humans and machine learning models.

## Current State

SprintLang is currently in the design stage. The basic syntax for defining project metadata, modules, sprints, and tasks has been outlined. The format allows for tasks to be defined in separate files for modularity and better organization. The language supports structured metadata, explicit relations, and standardized fields, making it suitable for processing by language models.

## To-Do

- complete the lml design
- create a Python library
- create command-line interface (CLI) program that
  - can parse SprintLang files
  - interact with the data,
  - provide summaries, suggestions, and other valuable project management insights (possibly using gpt-4)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether it's feedback on the language design, suggestions for features, or code for the upcoming Python program, all contributions are appreciated.
